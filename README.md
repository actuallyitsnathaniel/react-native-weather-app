# react-native-weather-app
A weather app similar to iOS, built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and a free [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Learned through [Spencer Carli's React Native School](learn.reactnativeschool.com) (2019).  
⚠️ This app's dependencies are either deprecated or long overdue for an update. It's quite likely that upon cloning this repo, it _will not work._ ⚠️
